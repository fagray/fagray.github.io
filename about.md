Howdy, I'm a guy with 2 arms, 2 legs, 20 fingers, 2 eyes, 2 ears, 24 ribs, 1 heart, 2 lungs, 2 kidneys, 2 feets, 2 hands, 2 balls and 1 brain, a well-cooked human to be exact by our creator. 

I like to sip a 2-4 cups of my morning coffee and 4 at the afternoon; in short, I'm a "coffee-holic", well better than alcholic. Before I start my work, I want to be caffeinated to stimulate my nerves and to let them handle my instructions.

I'm a developer, an aspiring software architect & game developer. That's all for now.
