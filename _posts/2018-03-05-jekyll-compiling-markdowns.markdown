Okay for my first shitless post, I ran into trouble when compiling markdowns on Jekyll. Then I found out that by default, Jekyll does not compile posts with future dates. Need to add "future : true" to be able to compile and generate a static layout for the content. Fuck Jekyll, you wasted my precious minutes.
